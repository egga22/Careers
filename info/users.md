# User Instructions

1. Open the site (via `index.html`) in your browser.
2. Use the X Axis and Y Axis dropdowns to pick the comparison dimensions (Alphabetical or Median Salary).
3. Hover over any bubble to see exact values for both axes and the median salary.
4. Click a bubble to open its career page with the current salary and name.
5. Use the Zoom controls (+, -, Reset) to adjust how much of the map you see.

Tips:
- Alphabetical uses the position of each career in A–Z order, while Median Salary uses the numeric salary value.
- If the tooltip overlaps your cursor, move slightly—the tooltip follows your movement.
